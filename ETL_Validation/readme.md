## Assignment-4: Production-Grade Incremental Pipeline

This assignment introduces operational maturity to the ETL pipeline:
- Structured logging with timestamps and severity levels
- Failure-safe execution using try/except
- Control table updates only after successful completion
- Graceful handling of no-data scenarios

This design prevents silent data loss and ensures pipeline observability.
